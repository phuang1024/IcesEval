# Correlation between GPA and faculty evaluations at UIUC

Course grades and student evaluations of teaching are factors important for the career of students and professors respectively.
When faculty evaluations are determined by students, the integrity of the system can be compromised, because these are desirable measures mutually given to each other.
We use novel data of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, and find a statistically significant positive correlation between GPA and teaching evaluations, and compute the strength of correlation in different departments.
